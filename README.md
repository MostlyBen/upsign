# What is UpSign?

UpSign is a project I thought I could make in a weekend.

The school I teach at has a unique schedule on Fridays, where teachers create a unique set of classes and students sign up for whatever sessions they want.
We need a more convenient way to get students signed up for the classes they want. So, I started making UpSign.
